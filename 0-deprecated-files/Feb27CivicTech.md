### Stephanie told a neat story about...
  + a lady who is sleeping on the street near where she lives at yonge and shepard.
  + She explained the lady sleeping there has accumulated so much gear (blankets and stuff) that her camp takes up most of the sidewalk
  + She was concerned that her camp might be cleared soon because of this.

### Josh noticed stuff on the card
+ The skyline on the front is actually New York, not Toronto. Should probably be changed

### Jason was talking about phones at shelters
  + Many people who stay at shelters have cell phones
    -this is very different compared to folks who sleep rough who Mister Chalmers has talked to, who almost never have cell phones
  + Many of those with cell phones had their phone plans suspended
  + Certain setlers are affiliated with certain programs
    -ex Daniel Spectrum in Regent Park had a program with Telus
    -got 50 people phones with telus
  + Zach knows a Redditor who was involved in getting a guy in unstable housing condition a phone with Telsus. He was a marketing guy at telus

### John mentioned a friend who works at a church near Kensington Market
  + He took a card to show her
  + She runs a soup kitchen out of the church
  + He explained she had a lot of experience working with the homeless population, and she might have some good ideas for the cards.

### Shelter map is thinking of using Twilio to automate intake line
  + Get their name, phone number, put that up on a centralized web app
    - allow for a person on the web app to say "yes that person can come to our place"
    - user gets a reservation at the place
  + Something like that
