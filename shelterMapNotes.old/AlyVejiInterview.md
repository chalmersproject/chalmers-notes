adult literacy program
  - english is their first language, but they haven't been able to develope their literacy skills
  - some may not be able to write their name; some have a basic skill level

# Services to vulnerable person worker
  + a way to connect together all of our programs for vulnerable people
    - there are often local initiatives unique to individual branches
    - there are also the central programs, like the ones described above
  + our focus is on folks experiencing homelessness

**The Library is the one safe free space anyone can use**
  + A lot of people who can't read may not go to the library,
  + internet access is the most common use of the library
  + information; referrals (shelter, programs, where to get food), books, resources
  + we don't track library usage; makes analytics hard but reduces stigma
  + there is often low awareness about what services and programs the library offers

# What are the grestest needs
  + basic understanding of how to use technology
    - search for information on the internet
    - navigating resources like community housing websites, government websites
    - after people 'get the runaround' they stop looking
  + we also want to talk to people with lived experience with homelessness, findout what folks want from the library
