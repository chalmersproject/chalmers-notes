  + Dellini can help make a presentation that explains the difference between SMIS and the program we're developing

# SHelter Interview notes
  + many Respite sites don't track people coming in
 
# Should we change our focus to just headcounts?
  + St. Felix does bi hourly headcounts to make sure they are under building capacity
  + Workers at Sistering usually have a good estimate of how many people are in the biulding

# New plan?
  + Making easier referrals seems to be a commonly requested feature from staff
  + Most locations do headcounts more often than they update SMIS
  + contacting central intake and SSHA is a huge painpoint for shelter staff

# Sistering Headcount
  + go around and physically count
  + staff would know most folks, many regulars, would call them by name.

# Action Items
  + building repour with shelter staff seems to be going well :D
  + Should talk to CG about current intake and headcount strategies at city shelters
