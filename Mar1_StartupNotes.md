# Feedback from Haman
  + Call them StreetCards maybe
    - perhaps conveys the purpose of the cards more clearly
    - however it may be presumptutous. The cards are just information on public resources. They target folks in unstable housing conditions, but there likely should not be an assumption that the user is street affiliated
### Reach hidden homeless
  + will give biggest impact

### Use RFID on cards
  + redeem for vending machine food
  + exchanges food for information that the person is still alive

### Donate money
  + pickup money from the bank

### Add useful tihngs
  + bottle opener
  + knife
  + sandwich thing

### Doing custom designs for funding
  + He'll let us know if

### New prototype feedback
  + Don't like the giant title
    - takes away from the message
  + Appreciates the subtlety of the old branding
    - only an email
    - small logo in subtle spots
