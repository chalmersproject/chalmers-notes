# Discussion Notes

## The Action item from last week: Potential problems to tackle
  + Andrew has compiled a list of potential problems to tackle [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ido5Dw8sICaHBUtI8UCXsQU0kKuxk6FYSI06FC6eKqg/edit#)

## Peter's action item: The Out of the Cold Program
Non profit out of the cold program has a trouble with central intake. They aren't well integrated with the central intake phone line or streets to homes intake center

  + OOTC opersates entirely on volunteers
  + OOTC locations are spread out over the city, and each day of the week will have a different location open
    - the [calendar](http://dixonhall.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-2018-OOTC-Program-Prepares-for-Launch-Amid-Growing-Concerns-Surrounding-Capacity-Press-Release-Final-1.pdf) is posted on the [dixon hall website](https://dixonhall.org/housingservices/ootc/)
#### Peter emailed one of the church members
  + Nina Aresnal from All Saints
  + there were a few occasions in the past year where they ran out of space in their shelter
  + she didn't know what to do to prevent others from showing up; people would be waiting at their door to get in even though they were full
    - a volunteer would have to call in to Central Intake to update them on bed counts, or if they were full up
    - the volunteer would get stuck in the long wait times of trying to through the shelter intake phone number
  + Dixon hall distributes a spreadsheet to each of the OOTC shelters where
    - contact information of client
  + in most cases these spreadsheets are not filled out
    - most of the clients are repeat users, so she didn't see much of the point
  + all of her volunteers have smartphones, as a prerequisite
  + they would like to have the ability to look for resources and shelter space themselves, rather than using the shelter refferal line.

# Group Thoughts
  + both OOTC and Winter Respite Center does not use SMIS
## Peter's Thoughts
  + Churchs that interact with OOTC change season to season, which is part of the reason OOTC doesn't use SMIS
## Joey's thoughts
  + it would make sense to put our focus on improving access to resource information for OOTC volunteers
  + anything to do with working with the city adds a lot of difficulty
  + it would be a lot easier to work with volunteers
## Marjorie's thoughts
  + because OOTC doesn't depend on SMIS, maybe we can introduce something for them to use in place of SMIS
## SMIS Demo
 + mary has shared notes of the SMIS demo on the [slack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BkbQOFqPrqk4wOSjUBTXW3nKJz-4p_iWQosJLTrDCk0/edit)
## CG
  + next thursday CG is doing a tour of Streets to Homes

# Spitballing ideas
  + a ticker (or turnstyle) at the door that keeps track of people moving into the shetler
  + live update from the ticker to a website that tracks capacity of shelter
  + volunteer said she would like a system with live updates
    - they are pressed for time doing intake and delivering meals and stuff
  + how do we collect shelter bed usage?
  + How do we transmit shelter bed usage we collect?
# Potential Project Direction
It seems like the way this project is going is building

# HOME TO meetup on Sunday
  + meeting up to do a synthesis of the notes from going to a transitional housing shelter
  + Contact CG to find out how to join in 
# Action items
 + get in contact with Gabe to ask about meeting with someone who works with Shelter System.
 - Maybe this hypothetical person would want to come to the design sprint??
 + __Get a Design Sprint Planned!!!!__
  - put in a time that works for you on the [WhenIsGood](http://whenisgood.net/9ki779n) calendar!
