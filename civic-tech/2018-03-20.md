## Anna's feedback
  + Group by need, issue, group, emergency help
  + Balance visual vs text
  + Connection between 211 and the resource categories was unclear
  + In new design, 211 becomes blended into city skyline
  + Maybe instead of "identification", "getting ID Reissued" or "ID clinics"

### Financial aid steps were unclear
  + It was unclear trhat they happen in steps

### Use Icons on 211
  + Use icons for needs like shelter, food and clothes
  + Leave abstract lines for groups of people and issues
    - indigenous
    - mental health
    - abuse

### Groupings of 211 resources
#### People
  + Indigenous
  + Womens support serviecs
  + Newcomers and refugees
#### Needs
  + Free food
  + Free clothes
  + Healthcare
  + Income support and employment
#### Issues
