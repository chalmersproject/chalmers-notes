## Anna's feedback
  + Group by need, issue, group, emergency help
  + balance visual vs text
  + connection between 211 and the resource categories was unclear
  + in new design, 211 becomes blended into city skyline
  + maybe instead of "identification", "getting ID Reissued" or "ID clinics"

## Financial aid steps were unclear
  + it was unclear trhat they happen in steps

## Use Icons on 211
  + use icons for needs like shelter, food and clothes
  + leave abstract lines for groups of people and issues
    - indigenous
    - mental health
    - abuse
