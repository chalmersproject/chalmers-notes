# Julie Mathews CLEO presentation
> Community Litigation Ontario

  + usually people do not go to lawyers first when they have legal troubles
    - they go to someone they know in the community they trust
  + now people also do google searches for legal trouble
    - but they do not know how to vet reliable information
    - the information is often too general
    - the information resource usually suggests getting legal help
  + family law, housing, employment:: main legal focuses, though they have 10 total
  + we have 3 plain language editors that translate what lawyers write into something someone with a grade 8 education could understand

# Arun's Feedback on the ChalmersCard (Version 9)
# make sure every item has an intentional meaning
  + the wolf being close to indigenous people is potentially hurtful
  + many of the icons taking up space are not useful
  + 211 kind of blends with the text
    + when I look at the card I see the content first, then I see 211 after
    + my focus is not on 211
  + something more meaningful for Women's support services icon

# the chalmers financial aid steps
  + make the headings more highlighted
# card next to financial aid steps
  + a lot of text here
  + perhaps instead of next to the URL the description, include an icon; like a dollar sign or something
  + maybe make the text more concise to make room for icons
# Put the steps next to the resources
  + for example: "Call Ontario Works" + [Toll free number]
  + it doesn't really matter who they have an appointment
# ID clinic
  + "an ID clinic happening close near you" is unclear phrasing
  + it's unclear what an ID clinic is

# I'm not sure who Mister Chalmers is

# Icon of
  + Telehealth
    -
  + Toronto Distress center
    - smily face
    - therapist
  + Streets to homes
    - icon of homeless shelter

# What words would resonate
  1. Does not Resonate
    + Telehealth?
  2. Resonates
    + Street
    + Homes
    + Shetler

# Emphasize which resources are 24

# Small text would be ahrd to read for someone who is older

# A diary study
  + ask this of a tester of a prototype
  > For the next few months use this as a reference. And when you use it to call 211, or one of the resources, can you write down what happened on a piece of paper or something?

  + design a small notebook which is contained inside the card
    - every two or three weeks go and take photos of those notebooks
  + you will have to give some incentives to use the diary study
  + Make it clear that this feedback is something we are really looking for, so we would really appreciate it
  + if something private was written in the notebook, instead ask them if there is something in the notebook they would like to share.

## maybe conduct diary study with 2 users as a pilot
  + run it for maybe a few days
  + make sure people involved have literacy skills
#### alternatively
  + the user could call us after calling maybe 211, and we could take notes on their behalf on their experience

# A dot map study
#### used to prioitize key ideas
  + everyone gets a round dot and sticks it on ideas people like
    - stick on a poster of the card
  + results in a heat map of what is used most often

# be sure to customize the card to a specific audience
  + for example: a 50 year old man will have different pain points from a 23 year old girl
