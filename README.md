# Chalmers Notes

To uphold transparency on everything that we're doing with the project. We upload in this repository all of our notes we take whenever we meet to work on Chalmers Cards.

We have two folders here the ```/civic-tech``` and ```/misc-meetups```.

* The first contains all the notes of our work when we meet at our weekly [civic tech hacknight](https://civictech.ca).
* The second contains all the notes from our ad-hoc meetups around the city.

If reading through these notes peaks your interest get in contact with us! You can talk to us on the chalmerscards channel on the [Civic Tech Toronto slack](https://civictechto.slack.com) or email us at misterchalmers@protonmail.com
