## Place Cards at locations where they'll be used
If cards with specific purposes were placed in locations where their use is applicable, they may get more use.
**For Example:**
  + A card with legal aid phone numbers nailed to the wall next to the free phone at streets to homes
  + A card with websites like toronto.ca/homelesshelp and financialaidhelp on display next to the computer access spots in shelters.
  + A poster on display in a shelter reception area with take away chalmesrCards underneath
