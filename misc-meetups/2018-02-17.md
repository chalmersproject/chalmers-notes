Mister Chalmers should be able to guide to an encounter with assistance.

But Mister Chalmers is a Spirit. Spirits only talk in actions. Spirits do not lead, they only show.

Like in ODST. Virgil says, keep right. Proceed with caution. [[Puts Red Square on map]] Not, there is any enemy squad ahead.

Simply a non-descriptive arrow, with Mister Chalmers on it.

  For example, laser cut street stickers. Distributing these would be semi-permanent, and in fewer batches than Chalmers Cards.

  Could afford to use simple electronics in these. Would justify the nfc sticker on the Chalmers card (Example: Tap Chalmers Card on Street sticker -- the arrow lights up/glows/goes rainbow colors; Maybe makes another arrow light up further down the road. ).
    Potential Light up rules;
    - The same NFC sticker can only be tapped once every 15 (or some duration) seconds.
    - Arrow stickers are placed in a one block radius around a resource center, plus one right outside resource center pointing in.
    - Perhaps around arrow sticker with electronics are regular arrow stickers. Makes light up arrow sticker more obvious without too much extra cost.
    - Stack the arrow sticker : Wood arrow | sandblasted acrylic sheet | box for electronics |
