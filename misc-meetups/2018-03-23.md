## Plug me in at the Library - "ChalmersCard"

    + lots of possibilities in a full operating system!! You could boot onto it And no battery reqiured!!! And simple USB storage for the less computer savvy
  + Great motivation to go to the library
  + instructions on how to boot onto the usb on the card
  + information on how to use it on the card
## Borrow TO mesh business structure of Install parties
  + Asembly parties for Chalmers Cards
    - learn about laser cutting, soldering, and raspberry pi
    - setup a Chalmers batch to laser
    - solder the electronics
    - install the pi
    - assemble after
## If each page is unique, it might make the each card, and their order, easier to remember
  + If each card was unique, with more space and icons, it may be that increasing the number of pages of the chalmers card would not decrease it's value.
