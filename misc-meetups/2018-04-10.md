# What the Toronto Public Library is working on for Torontonians who are unstably housed (& also ChlamersCard feedback)

# Adulty literacy program
  + helping adults read and write

  + developing programming

# Looking at placing a librarian inside a shelter
  + the types of services we provide in a branch but in a Shelter
    - information Services  
      - housing
      - Employment
    - Skills
    - Education programming
    - digital literacy

# Braqnches make referrals
  + Looking at building a system for staff so they could make referrals easier

# UofT Med students

    + posters on cancer society
    + poster on heart attacks
  + Test them with the adult literacy program
    - they meet with an adult literacy class and give some samples

# Weaknessess witht he card
  + never know what someone's literacy level is
    + always use lots of pictures
    + keep text simple



# Open Lab university health network
  + center for social innvoation

# Hygene on Wheels
  + the TTC bus that was converted to portable showers and toilets
  + She wants to link up with agencies that can provide support

# The library is not the first place people think about
  + only people who use the library regularly appreciate the programming thats available
    - things like adult literacy
    - computer literacy
    - computer programming
    - trained staff for finding information
### Maybe putting the library's reources on the card is a way on it's own to get people into the library

# Bad relationship with teh lirbary
  + we're a public space
  + we have a code of conduct
    + so if someone is drinkign or otherwise breaking conduct
  + sometimes it's the education of the staff, the staff may not be aware of what barriers they're facing
  + SHelters have said we've come a long way
####it would be great to know what causes that feedback
####### libraries that encounter a lot of homeless:
  + parliament
  + spadina and college
  + parkdale
