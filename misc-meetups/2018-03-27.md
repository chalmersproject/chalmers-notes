# Nicole Feedback
  + The differenc between expansion concepts and the model being distributed is unclear
  + Be more clear abou that the different models are dependant on whether you get funding
# Andrew feedback
  + Information printed on lens
  + information projected by light through lens onto surface
# Sarah feedback
  + flashdrive good idea if person has access to computers
  + having a focus on people having their own infroation instead of using others information (like the shelter referral line) is cool
  + its important to give clients their own tools, allow them to seek their own help

# Job feedback
  + good to empower people to organi nize their own help
  + there is a lot of critique in how we treat homeless people in this people
  + treating people with respect so they can find their own help

## expand beyond critical design
  +  using the usb is a good idea
  + getting them into a resource space could create a trail of help
    - follow the trail and find even more help  
  + sometimes when we give help there's a certain attitude to it
    - like how you talk to your cat
    - acknowledging a person is a person with atonomy is perhaps the greatest help you can give
    - there is help but there it goes throuhg the lens of respect
## presentation
  + show the context of use
  + presentation lacks tangibility

## adding tools
  + going well
  + be careful not to turn into "Homeless Gadget"
  + the value in the card has to be genuine
    - the pocket knife becomes like a swiss army knife
    - the compass is perhaps too gadgety
