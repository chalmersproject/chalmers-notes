# John's dropin feedback
  + some folks suggested they'd rather have the cards in plastic
  + a lot of the information was stuff people already know if they'd been on the street for a while
  + consider developing a poster for shelters. When they are at shelters they couldn't dfidn the information tehy need
    - specifically the information that is on the chalmers cards
  + Shelter referal going through central intake si something that is very closely guarded.
