# Feedback from Adeel
Feedback from a talk with Adeel at Project Spaces coworking space
### Feedback from the point of view of a client

  + I have cluster of problems that contribute to me bieng in the state that I'm in and unless that probelm is resloved I'm going to be panhandling
  + if calling the number on the front is going to help a problm then I will do it
  + If you can not tell me with confidence that it jill help, why the would I call the number
  + I have a problem that results in me being in psychological state of mind, that if not addressed, will prevent me from looking at the card.

### Questions the Chalmers Cards could ask it's user
  + how do i feel anbout what is being proposed
  + Have a way for me to express myself.

### General Principles
  1. That which is measued improves
  2. That which is measured and reported on improves exponentially

# Whatever the reason they're panhandling is what should be addressd

### The point of the prpoject is to stimulate a call to action
  + could be a part of an education strategy
    - doesn't have to be a cards
  + could be information and service delivered timely
    - I lost my job, get connected with the Toronto Unemplloyment fund
#### How do we get it to a point where it is engrained in their mind
  + should be focused on eductation
### New Resource for Card
  + Connex Ontario
  + Mental health service line

### Looking for positive feelings
  + Does the city skyline give positive feelings

### The call to action should be right on the front
  + The Chalmers Logo stands out, and the Chalmers title stands out
  + But the Call to action should stand out most
    - In the case of Version9 beta -- the 211
    - The free clothes food, assault counseling resouces.
  + Quantify which resources will have the most impact for users

#### The focus should be on the call to action
  + does the Mister Chalmers brand build trust
  + a call to action would be closer to the point
  + the short guy with the beard who works at vista print knows a lot about psychology and design

### Add Women's resources to card
  + even with adding womens on 211, somehting like if a person needs an abortion, the resource is still only implicit in "Womens services"
  + also the women's resource isn't currently listed

### Principles for systems Change
  + ask 'what one policy, if you changed it, changes the whole direction of the ship'
  + embrace the status quo to change the system
    - use terms that are used in the system as it is right now
    - talk in terms of existing resources in the system
  + ask the system how it can be changed
    - talk to someone already working in the system as it is currently
    - even if they disagree with the system change you're working towards will often have great ideas
  + challenge actors working in the existing system by appealing to their eith
  + the path to change will often change  
    - for example: an elected official with whom you've built a relationship will loose office
    - in this example, loosing this person may speed you towards your goal
    - you must hang on and be tenacious
# Pitch your startup
 + a formal process where you send an email explaining what your startup is about
