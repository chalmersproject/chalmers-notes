Hi there, 

A few folks and I make and distribute wooden information cards that are designed to be given out at Toronto's emergency shelters and to folks sleeping on the streets of Toronto. 

The cards contain contact information for some of Toronto/Ontario's public resources (Legal Aid, Toronto Distress Center, I.D. Clinics, Ontario Works). The information is organized into reasonable catagories, and layed out plainly. A lot of this information is otherwise hard to find (hidden on confusing websites/folks don't have easy access to the internet). 

The cards don't crumple, smell nice, and snap onto your backpack! We call them Chalmers Cards. More information and images at https://www.ChalmersCards.com. 

These cards have a higher demand than we are capable of producing while making them ourselves (~20 cards per week). We estimate current demand at ~100 cards per week.

This github directory contains the GCode batch files we usually run.

You'll find all other relevant design files elsewhere in the repository: https://github.com/misterchalmers/ChalmersCards/tree/master/ChalmersCard

We would like a quote for 100 card booklets. 

Thanks!!
