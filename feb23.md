The brothers I met today:
+ The older one had a lot to say. He told me that he was trying to get back to Oshawa with his brother.
+ He said he son was at his house alone. He had no shoes and said he was also trying to get money for some.
+ He showed me frostbite on his hand.
+ He told me his foster father asked him if he was going to die out there in Toronto

What Mike described to me today:
+ Imagine if people who were homeless had self sufficiency in the forest
##Focusing on Survival
###starter
+ Distribute efficient foil blankets
+ Distribute glove heaters
###Learner
+ Distribute camping stoves
+ Distribute backpacking equipment
+ teach to live in the parks peacefully.
###Master
+ Learn to forage in forest
+ Those that find peace in the forest could encourage folks left in the city to try foraging

What Mike stressed most was that it is stronger to stimulate a *paradigm shift* than to create a product. A product would ask a person to change their behaviour, but a paradigm is a change in thinking.

He also stressed the importance of building a community of adopters. I am only one person; It is a much stronger strategy to develope users who would train new users.

Maybe this is achievable if users are uniting for a cause. Like in 1984, how Winston believes the power to destroy the party is in the prolitariate.

This already exists in part with OCAP rallies. Some folks who sleep at shelters, and some folks who run shelters, get together a protest City Hall to get something particular changed. Like when they petitioned for Moss Park to be opened.
