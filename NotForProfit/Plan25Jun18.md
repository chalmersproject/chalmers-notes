# Two goals for [Chalmers Cards](https://www.chalmerscards.com) that I'd really like help with:


1. I'd like to develop the Chalmers Cards project so that without me cards would still be produced.


2. I'd like for the project to be able to produce and distribute 1000 cards per month.

>I have a couple thoughts on some ways these goals might be worked towards...


# How we might work towards these goals
**Maker Spaces**

So far I've identified 5 maker spaces in Toronto that have either expressed interest in, or have actively contributed to this project.
1. [HacklabTO](https://hacklab.to/)
2. [ProjectSpaces](https://www.projectspac.es/)
3. [Toronto Tool Library](https://torontotoollibrary.com/)
4. [Site3](https://www.site3.ca/)
5. [SteamLabs](https://steamlabs.ca/)


In order to get all 5 maker spaces cutting cards:


- I plan to get lenses for their laser cutters that are appropriate for cutting the cards


- I'll need to get volunteers trained on the laser and approved by maker space for access to the space.

Additionally, I'd like to pay for memberships at these maker spaces in exchange for using their lasers. Many of these maker spaces are not for profit spaces, and rely on memberships to continue operating.


**Volunteers**

A few months ago I brought a Chalmers Card to The Center for Social Innovation at Queen and Spadina. They sent out a message to their mailing list and a whole bunch of people volunteered help to cut cards!


I had a similar exchange at SteamLabs (a makerspace) and actually met up and cut cards there with one of their members!


Maybe each of the 5 identified maker spaces would be willing to send out a similar email?

# Questions I have

This leads me to some questions I have; Maybe you guys might be able to help me figure this out?


1. How might I get funding to pay for the laser lenses, maker space access, and wood


2. Would being a registered not for profit help access funding?


3. How might volunteers be authorized to access the funds so that the responsibility of these things might be shared?
    > buying wood
    > maintaining makerspace memberships
    > filling annual financial statements
    > other shtuff?


# TLDR
> I think that a neat way that Chalmers Cards could be cut and distributed in perpetuity is for volunteers to be trained and authorized to use laser cutters at maker spaces
>
> Some funding would be needed for some particular lenses for the lasers, and a continuous supply of wood and maker space memberships.
